# SMS_SpamClassification
Introduction
This project is a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier to detect spam messages.

Features
âœ… Preprocesses SMS messages (text cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)
âœ… Extracts features using TF-IDF Vectorization
âœ… Trains a Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes model
âœ… Predicts whether an SMS is spam or ham
âœ… Visualizes data insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Dataset
The dataset used is newsmsspam.csv, which contains labeled SMS messages.
Labels:
1 â†’ Spam
0 â†’ Ham
Installation & Setup
Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn
Run the Script
Clone the repository and run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classification.git
cd sms-spam-classification
python spam_classifier.py
Project Workflow
Load and preprocess the dataset
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering (word count, presence of currency symbols, numbers)
Train the NaÃ¯ve Bayes model
Predict whether a new SMS is spam or ham
Example Usage
You can test a sample message using the predict_spam() function:

python
Copy
Edit
sample_message = "Win a brand new iPhone! Click the link below to claim your prize."
if predict_spam(sample_message):
    print("Spam detected!")
else:
    print("This is a normal message.")
Results
Model Accuracy: (Add your accuracy score here, e.g., 95%)
Confusion Matrix Visualization: (Generated using Seaborn)
Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Improve preprocessing with advanced text cleaning techniques
ðŸ”¹ Implement deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for better classification
ðŸ”¹ Deploy the model as a Flask API or Web App
